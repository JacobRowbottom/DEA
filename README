% The following contains the MATLAB code used within my Thesis 
%for implementing DEA to approximate the Helmholtz equation in
%two-dimensions as described in Chapter 4 of my Thesis.

%For any questions please email me at: jacob.rowbottom2017@my.ntu.ac.uk

%Please copy the Raw data from the corresponding files you wish to use and
%save as mfiles with the same names as the ones labelled here.

%The Main Script file to run is named DEA. The other files are the function files used within
%the Script file. The Script file is annotated and explains which each variable or parameter is calculated. 
%The files in the folder Distmesh are apart of the Distmesh package used to
%calcualte the trinagular mesh used in the Figures in Chapter 4 of my
%Thesis. To edit the size of the mesh please edit the value "PpOm" on line
%287

%Edit lines 19 - 24 to define the parameters used in DEA 

%Edit lines 32 - 77 to change the number of domains and the coordinates of the vertices of the domain being considered.

%Edit lines 99 and 101 to change the total number of directions in the global set and the step size of the 
%boundary elements respectively.

%Edit lines 250 - 282, to edit the problem set up for either the case when there is a source point 
%inside the domain (Source = 1) or for the case when there is a line source travelling into the domain 
%(Source = 0 ). For the case when Source = 1, edit lines 273 - 274 to edit
%the coodinates of the source point. For the case when Source = 0 edit line
%258 to change the angle the source travels into the domain.

%Stage 4 at line 946 begins the computation of the final density defined sa FD in this code. 
%Line 993 contains the function file used to define the exact solution given by equation (4.37) in my Thesis.
